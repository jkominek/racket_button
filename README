3D print in white PLA. I suggest thinner layers towards the front (top
as it is printed) of the button.

  If you want to glue a magnet to the back {
    Abrade the back of the button, and the magnet
    Damp the back of the button and the abraded magnet surface
    Apply a ~2mm diameter drop of Gorilla Glue to the magnet
    Clamp to the back of the button
  }

Remove bumps, sand the raised surfaces with about 120 grit.

Use craft smart Metallic Blue and Metallic Red gloss acrylic paint,
available from Michael's. This will take 2-3 coats depending on how
thick you apply the paint.


The logo presumably belongs to PLT Design, Inc. I'm just trying to make
it available in a form that will let fans/supporters show a bit of Racket
pride. :)
